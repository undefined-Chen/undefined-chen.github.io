[{"content":"Welcome back, today we will travel from Kathmandu to Delhi, India. As the third-largest country in Asia, in 2023, India’s population surpassed China’s, becoming the largest in the world. India is not a country of a single ethnicity and culture; it is home to a multitude of ethnic groups, each with its own language and script. There are as many as 22 officially recognized languages in the constitution. According to Wikipedia:\nThe languages of India are incredibly complex. According to the 2001 census, there are 1,396 identifiable “mother tongues” spoken across India. These 1,396 mother tongues, upon linguistic analysis, can be grouped into additional “languages.” There are 29 languages in India with more than one million speakers and 121 languages with more than 10,000 speakers. These languages primarily belong to two major language families: the Indo-European family’s Indo-Aryan branch and the Dravidian family. In addition, some languages belong to the Tibeto-Burman branch of the Sino-Tibetan family and the Austroasiatic family’s Munda branch, as well as several other isolated languages.\nTranslated from the Chinese Wikipedia.\nLanguage region maps of India\nBy Filpro - Own work, based on the \u0026lsquo;Report of the Commissioner for linguistic minorities\u0026rsquo;, Govt. of India,(July 2012 to June 2013)- NCLM-50th report pdf archive copy at the Wayback Machine, CC BY-SA 4.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=51479325 Our destination, Delhi, is the second-largest city in India with a population of 17.65 million. Since the 6th century BCE, Delhi has been inhabited. For most of its history, Delhi has served as the capital for various kingdoms, including the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughal Empire. As a key city on the trade route from North India to the Ganges Plain, Delhi has left behind numerous historical sites and relics. The old city was the capital of the Mughal Empire for a considerable period, and after India’s independence, New Delhi became the federal capital. Since then, Delhi has gradually developed into a metropolis, gathering various ethnic groups from India. The expansion of the city has brought about environmental pollution, traffic congestion, and other issues; since India’s independence, Delhi has rapidly developed, and the income of its residents has increased swiftly. The origin of the name “Delhi” is a matter of debate. In Mongolian, “Delhi” means “world,” and it might have been named by the ruling class during the Mughal Empire period. However, the majority view is that a person named “Dhillu” once ruled this area. Some historians believe that “Dilli” is a corruption of “dehali”; “dehali” in Hindustani means “beginning or starting point,” so “Delhi” is also considered to be associated with the beginning of Indian characteristics, such as the Indus-Ganges Plain. Another theory suggests that the original name of Delhi was “Dhillika” (an ancient Indian vernacular), and the word “dhili” often refers to a location (a directional noun), which gradually evolved into the place name “Dilli.”\nReturning to Kathmandu, today we will fly on VATSIM as usual, and Zilong Wu will be flying with us.\nGood afternoon Kathmandu! Pushback and start up See ya! The airport in Kathmandu does not have a parallel taxiway as long as the runway, so a “Backtaxi” maneuver is required before takeoff.\nMAN FLEX 52 SRS A/THR BLUE Lift-off Due to the high surrounding terrain, after taking off from Kathmandu Airport, one must circle the airport to climb. I was once reported by air traffic control in Infinite Flight for using the wrong runway because of such procedures.\nHimalayas Reenactment of the Suruga Bay Near Mid-Air Collision Incident\nA few minutes later, I unexpectedly disconnected. When I reconnected, all I could hear in the cockpit was the TCAS RA’s “Descend Now!” command. Switching to an external view, I saw:\n“Suruga Bay” in the skies above Nepal Descend Now! Due to the short flight duration, after this “minor” incident, we entered Indian airspace and prepared for descent. Perhaps due to air pollution caused by the excessive population, or for other reasons, the visibility in the Delhi area at that time was only 4000 meters, and the entire Delhi in the game was covered in a blanket of white.\nLos visibility Entering the fog Touchdown Shutdown ","date":"2024-11-17T12:00:00+08:00","image":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/undefined-Chen/hugo-img/main/241117-10.webp","permalink":"https://undefined-chen.github.io/en/p/global-flight%232-flying-at-the-foot-of-the-himalayas-kathmandu-to-delhi/","title":"[Global Flight]#2 – Flying at the Foot of the Himalayas: Kathmandu to Delhi"}]
